## The Planet of Drive and Desire

If Venus shows *what* you want and *how* you love, **Mars** shows *how* you go after what you want. Mars is the planet of action, desire, ambition, anger, courage, and raw physical energy. Named for the Roman god of war, Mars governs everything from how you exercise and compete to how you handle confrontation and pursue the objects of your desire.

Your Mars sign is one of the most revealing placements in your birth chart for understanding motivation, energy, and the shape of your ambition.

## What Mars Rules in Astrology

**Physical energy and drive**: Your natural energy level, how you deploy physical effort, your relationship with exercise and exertion.

**Ambition and goal pursuit**: How you chase what you want — whether boldly, strategically, patiently, or aggressively.

**Anger and conflict**: How you get angry, how you express it, and how you recover from conflict.

**Courage and risk-taking**: What you are willing to fight for, and how you respond to challenges.

**Sexual desire**: Mars governs raw physical attraction and the pursuit of intimacy (Venus governs the romantic and emotional dimension).

**Competition**: How you perform under pressure, in competitive situations, or when resources are limited.

## Mars and Sexual Chemistry

Mars is one of astrology's primary indicators of sexual chemistry. When one person's Mars closely aspects another's Venus, sun, or moon, the attraction tends to be immediate and powerful.

Compatible Mars signs between partners often indicate:
- Naturally aligned physical energy levels
- Complementary desire styles
- Ability to motivate and excite each other
