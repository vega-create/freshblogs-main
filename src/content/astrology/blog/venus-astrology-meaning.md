## The Planet of Love and Beauty

Of all the planets in the birth chart, **Venus** is the one most directly connected to what we call love. Named for the Roman goddess of love and beauty (Aphrodite in Greek mythology), Venus governs attraction, pleasure, aesthetics, and the values that shape what we invest our hearts in.

Understanding your Venus sign is one of the most practically useful things astrology can offer, because it reveals not just what you want in love — but *how* you love, what makes you feel truly valued, and what you find genuinely beautiful in the world.

## What Venus Rules in Astrology

Venus has domain over several interconnected areas of life:

**Love and romance**: How you attract and are attracted to others; your romantic style and needs; what you find irresistible.

**Beauty and aesthetics**: Your personal style, taste in art and music, and how you beautify your environment.

**Values**: What genuinely matters to you at a deep level, beyond what you consciously espouse.

**Pleasure and comfort**: How you enjoy life; what you need to feel truly satisfied.

**Money and possessions**: What you spend money on reveals what you value — Venus governs both.

**Social grace**: Your natural charm, social ease, and ability to create harmony.
