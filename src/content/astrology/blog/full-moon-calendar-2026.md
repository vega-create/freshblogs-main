  - q: "What is a full moon's effect on zodiac signs?"
    a: "Full moons amplify emotions and bring hidden matters to light. They occur in specific zodiac signs each month, emphasizing the themes of that sign. The full moon most strongly affects the sign it is in, its opposite sign, and any sign with major planets near the full moon degree."
  - q: "What should you not do on a full moon?"
    a: "Avoid making permanent decisions when highly emotional, starting new conflicts, or overindulging in excess. Full moons heighten everything — great for releasing what no longer serves you, but not ideal for calm, rational decision-making."
  - q: "Is a full moon good for manifestation?"
    a: "Full moons are actually better for releasing and completing than for new manifestation (which is better at new moons). Use full moons to release limiting beliefs, complete projects, and celebrate progress made since the previous new moon."

## Working With the Full Moon Cycle

The moon completes its cycle from new to full approximately every 29.5 days, with each full moon occurring in a specific zodiac sign opposite to the sun's current position. This opposition between sun and moon creates a natural tension — and a natural illumination — that makes full moons the most emotionally charged lunar events of the month.

Each full moon is a chance to harvest what the month has grown, release what has outlived its purpose, and see clearly what was hidden in shadow. The zodiac sign the moon is in colors the specific themes that come into focus.

## Monthly Full Moon Guide for 2026

### January 13 — Full Moon in Cancer
The year's first full moon illuminates home, family, and emotional foundations. For all signs, this is a time when personal needs become impossible to ignore. Cancer and Capricorn feel this full moon most intensely — a confrontation between emotional security and professional ambition.

**What to do**: Spend time with family, address unresolved home issues, release emotional patterns from 2025 that no longer serve you.

### February 12 — Full Moon in Leo
Valentine's-adjacent and gloriously romantic, this full moon shines a spotlight on self-expression, creativity, and the desire to be truly seen. Leo full moons ask: *Are you letting yourself be known?*

**What to do**: Create something, celebrate yourself and others, address where you have been playing small in love or creative work.

### March 14 — Full Moon in Virgo
The spring full moon illuminates health, work, and the details that make or break daily life. Virgo full moons often trigger a reset in wellness routines and work habits.

**What to do**: Complete a project, do a health check-in, address what in your daily routine is no longer working.

### April 13 — Full Moon in Libra
With the sun in Aries (independence) opposing the moon in Libra (partnership), this full moon highlights the fundamental tension between self and other. Relationship dynamics come into full, sometimes uncomfortable, view.

**What to do**: Have honest relationship conversations, address imbalances in give-and-take, release relationships that have run their course.

### May 12 — Full Moon in Scorpio
The Scorpio full moon is among the year's most psychologically intense. Deep truths surface. Hidden financial matters or power dynamics come to light. Transformation becomes unavoidable for those who have been resisting it.

**What to do**: Face what you have been avoiding, release old grievances, engage in any transformative inner work you have been postponing.

### June 11 — Full Moon in Sagittarius
Summer begins with a full moon that calls everyone toward expansion, adventure, and truth-seeking. This full moon highlights where you have been playing it too safe or where your current beliefs may need updating.

**What to do**: Plan a trip, study something new, release limiting beliefs about what is possible for you.

### July 10 — Full Moon in Capricorn
Midsummer brings a serious, ambitious full moon that highlights career, public image, and long-term goals. Capricorn full moons often bring career developments — recognition for work well done, or the clear realization that a career path needs changing.

**What to do**: Review your career progress, complete a major professional task, address where ambition has come at the cost of personal life.

### August 9 — Full Moon in Aquarius
This late-summer full moon illuminates community, friendship, and the tension between individual identity and collective belonging. Aquarius full moons often bring unexpected revelations about groups you belong to — or should leave.

**What to do**: Connect with your community, reassess friendships, release group affiliations that no longer represent who you are.

### September 7 — Full Moon in Pisces
The harvest season opens with the year's most spiritually charged full moon. Pisces full moons bring dreams, intuitions, and emotional undercurrents to the surface — sometimes in overwhelming waves.

**What to do**: Journal your dreams, engage in spiritual practice, release any martyr or victim narratives you have been carrying.

### October 6 — Full Moon in Aries
Autumn's first full moon brings fire, independence, and the desire to act on accumulated impulses. Aries full moons often coincide with significant decisions about autonomy and self-determination.

**What to do**: Take brave action on something you have been hesitating about, release anger that has been building, set boundaries that need setting.

### November 5 — Full Moon in Taurus
As winter approaches, the Taurus full moon illuminates what you truly value, what you have built, and what you are holding onto past its expiration date. Material matters come into focus.

**What to do**: Assess your financial situation, release possessions or attachments you have outgrown, invest in something beautiful and lasting.

### December 4 — Full Moon in Gemini
The year's final full moon brings a burst of communicative energy and intellectual clarity. Gemini full moons often bring conversations that have been waiting to happen and information that was previously hidden.

**What to do**: Have important conversations, complete writing or communication projects, release information that has been weighing on you.

## How to Use Full Moon Energy

The three days around a full moon (day before, day of, day after) are the peak window for full moon work. During this time:

- **Emotions amplify**: What you normally manage easily may feel overwhelming. This is information, not a problem.
- **Endings feel natural**: This is the right time to close chapters, end relationships, quit habits.
- **Clarity arrives unexpectedly**: Hidden truths surface. Pay attention to what you suddenly see clearly.
- **Energy runs high**: Many people sleep less well around full moons. Use the extra energy productively.
